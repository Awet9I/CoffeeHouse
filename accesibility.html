          This page contains snapshot results of automated tests and breif
          reflection over the choices of coding style and how it it follows the
          guidlines and principles provided in Web Content Accessibility
          Guidelines (WCAG)2 and universal design principles. The results of the
          automated tests will include snapshots from the automated html tester

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Code Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Besides checking the code on automated tests, I have also based my
          choices of coding by following the guidelines of Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)2 . The full details of the guideline
          can be found by
          <a class="topic-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/">
            following this link.</a
          >
          In addition, when creating and building this website, I incorporated
          the ideas of inclusive design and universal design into this website.
        </p>

        <h4 style="text-align: center">Page structure</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Contents throughout the pages of a website are designed so that they
          allow efficient navigation and facilitate assistive technologies work.
          Regions of the pages are defined according to their function and
          location in the page. This way, assistive technologies and web
          browsers can identify them easily. Example all pages contain header,
          navigation list, main content and footer. These regions are
          distinguished clearly by using different colours and backgrounds.
          Elements that are used across the pages are also appropriate to their
          content. For example, table tag is used to present the content of the
          menu, book table page uses form for the book table form, all pages use
          list of links to present the navigation links and other contents are
          presented using section and article tags. Headings are nested
          logically, starting with heading 1 at the top and decreasing towards
          the bottom of the page. This way, screen reader softwares can skim
          through a page in natural manner. Keyboard users will also able to
          find their contents more efficiently.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4 style="text-align: center">Menu</h4>
        <p>
          The menu is designed to be consistent throughout the website. It is
          also easy to distinguish from the rest of the page. The colour of the
          background and the navigation links combined give good look for the
          page and it easy to locate as the links change colour when hovered
          over.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4 style="text-align: center">Images</h4>
        <p>
          Images in this website are used both for informative and decorative
          purposes. In some places I have used a div tag and gave this tag a
          role of image. I came across a solution
          <a
            class="topic-link"
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.php"
          >
            that can be found here</a
          >, which worked better for my page look. I also read on one of the
          guideline of WCAG2 standard guidelines
          <a
            class="topic-link"
            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/"
          >
            that can be found here</a
          >, that using WAI-ARIA code a div can define a role of a tag. The alt
          attribute is not defined in these elements since the tests returned an
          error becouse of it. The images presented by img tag has good alt
          description that users with disabilities or if image is not being
          rendered for some reason, can get another option of understanding the
          content of the image.
