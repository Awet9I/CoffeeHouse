        <h3>More facts...</h3>
        <p>
          Its “LT” name refers to the fact that it’s a “longtail” version of the
          720s model,<a
            class="topic-link"
            href="https://cars.mclaren.com/us-en/super-series/720s"
            target="_blank"
          >
            follow this link to see a pictur</a
          >, with wich it shares many components. The mid-engined 765LT is
          powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that is also featured in
          its 720S sibling. While the LT also feeds the rear wheels through a
          seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, its mill has been
          fortified with parts from the Senna. These upgrades help the Longtail
          produce 755 horsepower—45 ponies more than the 720S. Its noxious fumes
          and furious sounds that grow louder the harder its gas pedal is
          pressed are released through a set of high-mounted exhaust ports. We
          estimate that the 765LT will hit 60 mph in 2.4 seconds and charge from
          naught to 100 mph in just 5.4 ticks. The 765LT demonstrates the same
          preternatural track abilities and communicative feedback that makes
          the 720S so great. And our experience with that McLaren has proved the
          company knows how to tune a chassis and immerse drivers every time
          they get behind the wheel. The interior can be customized with a mix
          of soft-grain leather and faux-suede upholstery as well as myriad
          color combinations. However, the LT's interior has been optimized to
          reduce weight and boost performance. However, climbing in and out of
          the thing continues to be a pain in the ass and there's virtually no
          cargo space. 765LT is limited-production vehicle and only 765 units of
          the 765LT Spider will be produced in total.
